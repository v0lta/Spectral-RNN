Sequence Prediction using Spectral RNNs
------------------------------------
Source code for spectral RNN learning with optimizable window functions.
The window functions are available in `src/window_learning.py`.
The code has been tested using Tensorflow 1.10.0 on Ubuntu-Linux.

###### Experiments:

 - To recreate the synthetic experiments run `synthetic_signal_test.py` after adjusting the hyperparameters as described in the paper.
   The results may be plotted by using `synthetic_signal_plot.py` after adjusting the log file path in that file.

 - To run the power prediction experiments, download:
   http://www.wolter.tech/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/power_data.zip
   And extract it in the `src/power_experiments` folder. Then run `power_train_exp.py`
   from within the same directory with the desired parameters.

 - The mocap experiments use the human3.6m data set available at
   http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/ .
   We use the D3 Position files from the "by subject category". 
   After downloading and pickling the data run `mocap_train_exp.py` to repeat the experiments in the paper.

In the demo, the desired behavior is shown on the left, while the right side depicts the network predictions.
The red and blue colored stick figures are context; the green and yellow figures show the ground truth and network output. The selection is not balanced. I have chosen examples which worked well.
